# My Portfolio Projects

### [Django School API](https://github.com/Ededu1984/Django_API_School) - Finished

This API created in Django Rest Framework is about a fictional school. Token and basic authentications 
were implemented as well as swagger and redoc documentation.

### [Object detection Forza Horizon 4](https://github.com/Ededu1984/car_detection_forza_horizon) - Finished

This computer vision project is about a object detection of Forza Horizon 4 gameplay video. Some frameworks and libraries 
were used such as: OpenCV, YoloV4, Darknet and Numpy.

### [Disaster-tweets](https://github.com/Ededu1984/Disaster-tweets) - Finished

The file contains over 11,000 tweets associated with disaster keywords like ‚Äúcrash‚Äù, ‚Äúquarantine‚Äù, and ‚Äúbush fires‚Äù as well as the location and keyword itself. The data structure was inherited from Disasters on social media
The tweets were collected on Jan 14th, 2020. The intention in this project is to predict the sentiment behind the tweets, whether it is a disaster message or not.

### [San Francisco Crime Classification](https://github.com/Ededu1984/San_Francisco_Crime_Classification) - Finished

From 1934 to 1963, San Francisco was infamous for housing some of the world's most notorious criminals on the inescapable island of Alcatraz.
Today, the city is known more for its tech scene than its criminal past. But, with rising wealth inequality, housing shortages, and a proliferation of expensive digital toys riding BART to work, there is no scarcity of crime in the city by the bay.
From Sunset to SOMA, and Marina to Excelsior, this competition's dataset provides nearly 12 years of crime reports from across all of San Francisco's neighborhoods. Given time and location, you must predict the category of crime that occurred.

The chosen approach was to develop a stacking model and a neural network to analyze the problem.
