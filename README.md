### Hi there 👋


🔭 I’m currently looking for a new job in data science and machine learning segment since I am a professional in career transition . Experience with Python and Matlab in the academic area for 2 years acquired in my master's degree.
I have a self-taught profile, problem solver and passionate about challenges. My projects are available here and I've been participating of Machine Learning competitions on the kaggle platform.

Skills:

- Regression, Classification and Clustering: SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-means, Ensemble, ADABoost and XGBoost.

- Feature selection: Lasso, Boruta, Permutation importance and ANOVA.

- Neural Networks using Tensorflow and Keras (CNN and RNN).

- SQL (MySQL and MS SQL Server)

- Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn and Pytorch)

- Spark

- PowerBI and Tableau

- R

- Docker and Virtualenv

- Linux/Ubuntu

# My Portfolio Projects


### [Client-Churn-Prediction](https://github.com/Ededu1984/Client-Churn-Prediction) - Finished

TopBank is a large fictional banking company. It operates mainly in European countries offering financial products, from bank accounts to investments, including some types of insurance and investment products.
In general, Churn is a metric that indicates the number of customers who have canceled the contract or have stopped buying your product within a certain period of time. For example, customers who canceled the service contract or after it expired, did not renew it, they are considered churn customers.
The goal of this project is to predict which customers will be churned.

### [Digit recognizer](https://github.com/Ededu1984/Digit_recognizer) - Finished

Description
MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

The goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.

### [ENEM 2019](https://github.com/Ededu1984/Imersao-dados-2019) - Finished

A sample of the microdata available on the INEP website was created and made available on Alura's GitHub. The objective of this 
project was to analyze the ENEM data to assess the impact on the enrolled scores for the test.

### [Brazilian exports](https://github.com/Ededu1984/Brazilian-Exports-and-TFP) - Finished

Comex Stat is a system for consulting and extracting data from Brazilian foreign trade. Detailed data on Brazilian exports and imports are released monthly, extracted from SISCOMEX and based on the declaration of exporters and importers. 
The goal of this project is to predict the exportation for the upcoming years using time series algorithms.
The dataset contains all trackings of monthly imports and exports of a range of products (soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, corn, wheat and sugar) by brazilian states.

### [Object detection Forza Horizon 4](https://github.com/Ededu1984/Brazilian-Exports-and-TFP) - Finished

This computer vision project is about a object detection of Forza Horizon 4 gameplay video. Some frameworks and libraries 
were used such as: OpenCV, YoloV4, Darknet, Tensorflow and Keras.

### [Cardiovascular-Disease](https://github.com/Ededu1984/Cardiovascular-Disease) - Ongoing


This case was created to investigate the cardiovascular condition of some individuals with the characteristics that commonly produce this kind of disease. This classification model has a dataset composed by 12 features that will 
support the data scientist to figure out the outcome. In this case, the outcome is the patient has or not cardiovascular disease.
