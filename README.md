# My Portfolio Projects


### [Client-Churn-Prediction](https://github.com/Ededu1984/Client-Churn-Prediction) - Finished

Project to analyze whether a customer will be in churn situation based on a data set from other customers.

### [Digit recognizer](https://github.com/Ededu1984/Digit_recognizer) - Finished

Description
MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto ‚Äúhello world‚Äù dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

The goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.

### [ENEM 2019](https://github.com/Ededu1984/Imersao-dados-2019) - Finished

A sample of the microdata available on the INEP website was created and made available on Alura's GitHub. The objective of this 
project was to analyze the ENEM data to assess the impact on the enrolled scores for the test.

### [Brazilian exports](https://github.com/Ededu1984/Brazilian-Exports-and-TFP) - Finished

Comex Stat is a system for consulting and extracting data from Brazilian foreign trade. Detailed data on Brazilian exports and imports are released monthly, extracted from SISCOMEX and based on the declaration of exporters and importers. 
The goal of this project is to predict the exportation for the upcoming years.
The dataset contains all trackings of monthly imports and exports of a range of products (soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, corn, wheat and sugar) by brazilian states.

### [Cardiovascular-Disease](https://github.com/Ededu1984/Cardiovascular-Disease) - Ongoing


This case was created to investigate the cardiovascular condition of some individuals with the characteristics that commonly produce this kind of disease. This classification model has a dataset composed by 12 features that will 
support the data scientist to figure out the outcome. In this case, the outcome is the patient has or not cardiovascular disease.
