### [Health Insurance Prediction](https://github.com/Ededu1984/Health_Insurance_Prediction) - Finished

Insurance All is a company that provides health insurance to its customers and the product team is analyzing the possibility of offering policyholders a new product: auto insurance. As with health insurance, customers of this new auto insurance plan need to pay an amount annually to Insurance All to obtain an amount insured by the company,
intended for the costs of an eventual accident or damage to the vehicle. This project intends to predict which customers are more likely to accept this new service provided by Insurance All.

### [Client-Churn-Prediction](https://github.com/Ededu1984/Client-Churn-Prediction) - Finished

TopBank is a large fictional banking company. It operates mainly in European countries offering financial products, from bank accounts to investments, including some types of insurance and investment products.
In general, Churn is a metric that indicates the number of customers who have canceled the contract or have stopped buying your product within a certain period of time. For example, customers who canceled the service contract or after it expired, did not renew it, they are considered churn customers.
The goal of this project is to predict which customers will be churned.

### [Brazilian exports](https://github.com/Ededu1984/Brazilian-Exports-and-TFP) - Finished

Comex Stat is a system for consulting and extracting data from Brazilian foreign trade. Detailed data on Brazilian exports and imports are released monthly, extracted from SISCOMEX and based on the declaration of exporters and importers. 
The goal of this project is to predict the exportation for the upcoming years using time series algorithms.
The dataset contains all trackings of monthly imports and exports of a range of products (soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, corn, wheat and sugar) by brazilian states.
