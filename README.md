### Hi there üëã


üî≠ I‚Äôm a professional focused on data science and machine learning where I have been studying since 2019. Experience with Python and Matlab in the academic area for 2 years acquired in my master's degree.
I have mastery of all stages of developing a business solution using the concepts and tools of Data Science, from understanding the business to publishing the model in production using Clouds.
I have already developed solutions for important business problems such as detecting fraud in transactions, classifying diseases early, identifying customers in churn, prioritizing customers for cross-selling, object detection and timeseries problems.


**Analytical Tools:**

**Data Collect and Storage:** SQL, MySQL, Postgres, SQL Server and Hive.

**Data Processing and Analysis:** R, Python, Spark and Airflow.

**Development:** Git, Linux and Docker. 

**Data Vizualization:** Tableau and PowerBI.

**Machine Learning Modeling:** Classification, Regression, Clustering, Time Series, Deep Learning and NLP.

# My Portfolio Projects


### [Client-Churn-Prediction](https://github.com/Ededu1984/Client-Churn-Prediction) - Finished

TopBank is a large fictional banking company. It operates mainly in European countries offering financial products, from bank accounts to investments, including some types of insurance and investment products.
In general, Churn is a metric that indicates the number of customers who have canceled the contract or have stopped buying your product within a certain period of time. For example, customers who canceled the service contract or after it expired, did not renew it, they are considered churn customers.
The goal of this project is to predict which customers will be churned.

### [Digit recognizer](https://github.com/Ededu1984/Digit_recognizer) - Finished

Description
MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto ‚Äúhello world‚Äù dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

The goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.

### [ENEM 2019](https://github.com/Ededu1984/Imersao-dados-2019) - Finished

A sample of the microdata available on the INEP website was created and made available on Alura's GitHub. The objective of this 
project was to analyze the ENEM data to assess the impact on the enrolled scores for the test.

### [Brazilian exports](https://github.com/Ededu1984/Brazilian-Exports-and-TFP) - Finished

Comex Stat is a system for consulting and extracting data from Brazilian foreign trade. Detailed data on Brazilian exports and imports are released monthly, extracted from SISCOMEX and based on the declaration of exporters and importers. 
The goal of this project is to predict the exportation for the upcoming years using time series algorithms.
The dataset contains all trackings of monthly imports and exports of a range of products (soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, corn, wheat and sugar) by brazilian states.

### [Object detection Forza Horizon 4](https://github.com/Ededu1984/car_detection_forza_horizon) - Finished

This computer vision project is about a object detection of Forza Horizon 4 gameplay video. Some frameworks and libraries 
were used such as: OpenCV, YoloV4, Darknet and Numpy.

### [Health Insurance Prediction] (https://github.com/Ededu1984/Health_Insurance_Prediction) - Ongoing

Insurance All is a company that provides health insurance to its customers and the product team is analyzing the possibility of offering policyholders a new product: auto insurance.
As with health insurance, customers of this new auto insurance plan need to pay an amount annually to Insurance All to obtain an amount insured by the company, intended for the costs of an eventual accident or damage to the vehicle.
This project intend to predict which customers are more likely to accept this new service provided by the Insurance All.



### [Cardiovascular-Disease](https://github.com/Ededu1984/Cardiovascular-Disease) - Ongoing


This case was created to investigate the cardiovascular condition of some individuals with the characteristics that commonly produce this kind of disease. This classification model has a dataset composed by 12 features that will 
support the data scientist to figure out the outcome. In this case, the outcome is the patient has or not cardiovascular disease.
