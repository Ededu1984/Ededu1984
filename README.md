# My Portfolio Projects

### [Digit recognizer](https://github.com/Ededu1984/Digit_recognizer) - Finished

Description
MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto ‚Äúhello world‚Äù dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

The goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.

### [ENEM 2019](https://github.com/Ededu1984/Imersao-dados-2019) - Finished

A sample of the microdata available on the INEP website was created and made available on Alura's GitHub. The objective of this 
project was to analyze the ENEM data to assess the impact on the enrolled scores for the test.
