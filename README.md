# My Portfolio Projects

### [Django School API](https://github.com/Ededu1984/Django_API_School) - Finished

This API created in Django Rest Framework is about a fictional school. Token and basic authentications 
were implemented as well as swagger and redoc documentation.

### [Object detection Forza Horizon 4](https://github.com/Ededu1984/car_detection_forza_horizon) - Finished

This computer vision project is about a object detection of Forza Horizon 4 gameplay video. Some frameworks and libraries 
were used such as: OpenCV, YoloV4, Darknet and Numpy.

### [Health Insurance Prediction](https://github.com/Ededu1984/Health_Insurance_Prediction) - Finished

Insurance All is a company that provides health insurance to its customers and the product team is analyzing the possibility of offering policyholders a new product: auto insurance. As with health insurance, customers of this new auto insurance plan need to pay an amount annually to Insurance All to obtain an amount insured by the company,
intended for the costs of an eventual accident or damage to the vehicle. This project intends to predict which customers are more likely to accept this new service provided by Insurance All.

### [Client-Churn-Prediction](https://github.com/Ededu1984/Client-Churn-Prediction) - Finished

TopBank is a large fictional banking company. It operates mainly in European countries offering financial products, from bank accounts to investments, including some types of insurance and investment products.
In general, Churn is a metric that indicates the number of customers who have canceled the contract or have stopped buying your product within a certain period of time. For example, customers who canceled the service contract or after it expired, did not renew it, they are considered churn customers.
The goal of this project is to predict which customers will be churned.

### [San Francisco Crime Classification](https://github.com/Ededu1984/San_Francisco_Crime_Classification) - Finished

From 1934 to 1963, San Francisco was infamous for housing some of the world's most notorious criminals on the inescapable island of Alcatraz.
Today, the city is known more for its tech scene than its criminal past. But, with rising wealth inequality, housing shortages, and a proliferation of expensive digital toys riding BART to work, there is no scarcity of crime in the city by the bay.
From Sunset to SOMA, and Marina to Excelsior, this competition's dataset provides nearly 12 years of crime reports from across all of San Francisco's neighborhoods. Given time and location, you must predict the category of crime that occurred.

The chosen approach was to develop a stacking model and a neural network to analyze the problem.
